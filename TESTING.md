## Test Execution

### Running the Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests
php run-test-suite.php

# Run specific test groups
php run-test-suite.php --unit
php run-test-suite.php --integration
php run-test-suite.php --feature
php run-test-suite.php --frontend
php run-test-suite.php --browser
php run-test-suite.php --performance

# Run with options
php run-test-suite.php --parallel --headless --stop-on-failure
```

### Individual Test Execution

```bash
# PHP/Laravel Tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/Models/VehicleTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/Api/CarControllerTest.php
php artisan test tests/Integration/ArchitecturalIntegrationTest.php

# Frontend Tests
npm test tests/Frontend/Components/VehicleCardTest.js

# Browser Tests
php artisan dusk tests/Browser/CompleteApplicationFlowTest.php
```
