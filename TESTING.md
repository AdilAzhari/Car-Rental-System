## Running Tests

### Quick Test Execution

Run the comprehensive test suite using the batch script:

```bash
./run-tests.bat
```

This will execute all test types and generate coverage reports.

### Individual Test Suites

#### Unit Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit
```

#### Feature Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature
```

#### Browser Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Browser
```

#### Architecture Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Arch
```

#### Performance Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Performance
```

#### Snapshot Tests
```bash
vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/SnapshotTest.php
```

### With Coverage Reports
```bash
vendor/bin/pest --coverage --coverage-html=coverage/html
```

## Test Coverage

The testing suite provides comprehensive coverage for:

### Unit Tests Coverage
- **Models**: 100% coverage of all model relationships, attributes, and business logic
- **Enums**: Complete coverage of all enum values and methods
- **Factories**: Validation of factory data generation
- **Relationships**: Testing of all Eloquent relationships

### Feature Tests Coverage
- **Authentication**: Login, registration, password reset, email verification
- **User Management**: CRUD operations, role-based access control
- **Vehicle Management**: CRUD operations, status management, image handling
- **Booking System**: Creation, validation, status management, calendar integration
- **Payment Processing**: Multiple payment methods, refunds, validation
- **Review System**: Creation, moderation, analytics

### Browser Tests Coverage
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full dashboard functionality
- **User Authentication**: Complete authentication flows
- **Vehicle Management**: End-to-end vehicle operations
- **Booking Workflow**: Complete booking process from creation to completion

### Architecture Tests Coverage
- **Code Structure**: Ensures proper separation of concerns
- **Dependencies**: Validates dependency flow and architecture rules
- **Security**: Checks for security best practices
- **Laravel Conventions**: Ensures adherence to Laravel standards

### Performance Tests Coverage
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and N+1 problem detection
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption monitoring
- **Response Times**: API and page load time validation
- **Concurrent Load**: Stress testing under high load

## Code Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:

- **HTML Report**: `coverage/html/overall/index.html` - Interactive web interface
- **Clover XML**: `coverage/overall-clover.xml` - For CI/CD integration
- **Text Report**: `coverage/coverage-summary.txt` - Command line summary

### Coverage Targets

- **Overall Coverage**: Target 85%+
- **Model Coverage**: Target 95%+
- **Controller Coverage**: Target 80%+
- **Feature Coverage**: Target 90%+

## Architecture Testing

The architecture tests ensure:

### Code Quality
- Proper class naming conventions
- Strict type declarations
- No global functions in app namespace
- Interface compliance

### Dependency Management
- Controllers don't depend on each other
- Models don't depend on controllers or requests
- Proper separation of concerns

### Security
- No debug statements in production code
- Proper authorization implementation
- Mass assignment protection

### Laravel Conventions
- Models extend Eloquent
- Controllers extend base Controller
- Requests extend FormRequest
- Proper middleware structure

## Performance Testing

Performance tests monitor:

### Database Performance
- Query execution times (< 100ms per query)
- N+1 query detection
- Bulk operation efficiency
- Complex query optimization

### Memory Usage
- Memory consumption during bulk operations (< 50MB increase)
- Pagination efficiency (< 10MB per page)
- Relationship loading optimization

### Response Times
- Page load times (< 2 seconds)
- API response times (< 1 second)
- Dashboard rendering (< 3 seconds)

### Stress Testing
- Concurrent user load (100 users in < 10 seconds)
- Bulk booking creation (250 bookings in < 15 seconds)
- High-volume data processing

## Snapshot Testing

Snapshot tests ensure consistency in:

### API Responses
- Vehicle listing structure
- Booking creation responses
- User profile data
- Error response formats

### Database Queries
- Complex query structures
- Search query optimization
- Relationship loading patterns

### Configuration
- Database configuration structure
- Mail configuration consistency
- Application settings validation

## Browser Testing Setup

### Prerequisites
- Chrome/Chromium browser installed
- ChromeDriver (automatically managed by Pest v4)
- Application running on test environment

### Configuration
Browser tests are configured to:
- Use SQLite in-memory database
- Reset database between tests
- Handle JavaScript interactions
- Capture screenshots on failure

## Mutation Testing (Infection)

Mutation testing configuration is included to:
- Validate test quality
- Identify untested code paths
- Ensure tests actually verify behavior
- Improve overall test effectiveness

## Continuous Integration

The testing suite is CI/CD ready with:
- PHPUnit XML configuration
- Multiple report formats
- Parallel test execution support
- Coverage threshold enforcement

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. Use factory data for consistency
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Data
1. Use factories for model creation
2. Create realistic test scenarios
3. Test with various user roles
4. Include boundary value testing

### Performance Considerations
1. Use database transactions for speed
2. Minimize I/O operations in tests
3. Use in-memory databases for unit tests
4. Parallelize test execution where possible

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Update snapshots when intentional changes occur
2. Review and update performance thresholds
3. Add tests for new features
4. Monitor coverage reports
5. Update architecture rules as needed

### Test Environment
1. Keep test database clean
2. Update test dependencies regularly
3. Maintain consistent test data
4. Monitor test execution times

## Reports and Analytics

Test execution generates comprehensive reports:

1. **Test Summary**: Overall pass/fail status and execution time
2. **Coverage Report**: Line, branch, and method coverage statistics
3. **Performance Report**: Response time and resource usage metrics
4. **Architecture Report**: Compliance with coding standards
5. **Browser Test Screenshots**: Visual regression testing artifacts

## Integration with Development Workflow

The testing suite integrates with:
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- Code review processes
- Deployment validation
- Performance monitoring

This comprehensive testing framework ensures the Car Rental System maintains high quality, performance, and reliability throughout its development lifecycle.
